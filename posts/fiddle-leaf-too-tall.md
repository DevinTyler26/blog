Congratulations on your thriving fiddle leaf fig tree! As your plant reaches new heights, it can be a bit daunting to figure out what to do next. Here are a few tips on how to care for your fiddle leaf fig as it reaches the ceiling:

1. **Prune and shape your plant:** As your fiddle leaf fig grows taller, it may start to become leggy and lose its shape. Prune any branches that are too long or too thin to help maintain the overall shape of the plant. This will also encourage new growth and bushier foliage.

2. **Provide support:** As your fiddle leaf fig grows taller, it may need some support to keep it from falling over. You can do this by staking the plant or using a plant support such as a trellis.

3. **Rotate your plant:** As your fiddle leaf fig grows taller, it may start to lean towards the light source. To prevent this, rotate your plant every few weeks so that all sides of the plant have a chance to get even light.

4. **Provide the right amount of light:** Fiddle leaf figs need bright, indirect light in order to thrive. Make sure that your plant is getting enough light by placing it near a window or using a grow light.

5. **Keep an eye on humidity:** Fiddle leaf figs like humidity, so make sure to keep the humidity levels high in your home. You can do this by using a humidifier or by placing a tray of water near the plant.

By following these tips, you can help your fiddle leaf fig continue to thrive as it reaches new heights. Remember to be patient, as it will take time for your plant to adjust to its new environment. Happy gardening!
