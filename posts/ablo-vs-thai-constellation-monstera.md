Monstera plants have taken the world by storm with their mesmerizing foliage and low-maintenance nature, but none more so than the elusive Monstera Albo and Monstera Thai Constellation.

## Propagation Methods

One of the most perplexing differences between the two plants lies in their propagation methods. The Monstera Albo is usually propagated through cuttings, while the Monstera Thai Constellation is typically propagated through tissue cultures. Cuttings can be taken from both the top and mid-sections of the stem, but top cuttings tend to be more commonly used for both varieties.

## Leaf Shape

Leaf shape is another aspect that sets these plants apart. The Monstera Albo has small, oval-shaped leaves with prominent white variegation patches, while the Monstera Thai Constellation boasts larger leaves with irregular-shaped holes and numerous smaller patches of white and light green variegation. The Thai Constellation is considered a large form Monstera, while Albo is a small form Monstera, adding another layer of complexity to the mix.

## Variegation Levels

Perhaps the most bewildering difference between the two plants lies in their variegation levels. While Monstera Albo has larger patches of white variegation on its leaves, the Thai Constellation has a more intricate pattern of smaller, more numerous patches that blend seamlessly into the leaves. Additionally, the variegation on the Thai Constellation is considered stable, meaning that it is less likely to change over time or revert back to green leaves. Albo plants, on the other hand, are more prone to instability in their variegation and may revert back to all green leaves.

## Light Requirements for Heavily Variegated Leaves

However, one critical aspect that plant enthusiasts must consider is the light requirements of these plants. While both the Monstera Albo and Monstera Thai Constellation prefer bright, indirect light, heavily variegated leaves require more light to maintain their vibrant colors. Insufficient light can cause the variegation to fade, and the leaves may eventually turn green. On the other hand, direct sunlight can scorch the leaves, especially on plants that are not accustomed to high light levels. It's best to provide filtered or diffused light to your Monstera plants, and avoid placing them in direct sunlight for extended periods of time.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, Monstera Albo and Monstera Thai Constellation are enigmatic plants that continue to captivate plant lovers across the globe. While their differences may seem baffling at first, understanding these variations is crucial to provide them with the right care and ensure their longevity. Whether you opt for the elegant simplicity of the Albo or the intricate allure of the Thai Constellation, one thing is certain â€“ these plants are sure to add a burst of energy and color to any space they inhabit.
