Quarantine is a term you often hear in the context of public health, but did you know it's also an important step in caring for your house plants? Whether you're an avid plant collector or simply looking to bring some greenery into your home, it's important to understand the benefits of quarantining new house plants before adding them to your collection.

## Protect against disease and pests

One of the primary reasons to quarantine new house plants is to protect your existing collection from any diseases or pests they may have picked up at the nursery or garden center. New plants can introduce pathogens and insects that can quickly spread and wreak havoc on your other plants. Quarantining them for a few weeks allows you to observe them for any signs of problems and treat them before they spread to the rest of your collection.

## Adjust to new environment

Another reason to quarantine new house plants is to give them a chance to adjust to their new environment. This can include changes in temperature, humidity, and light, as well as a different type of soil or water. Quarantining them gives them a chance to acclimate without the stress of being surrounded by other plants.

## What should you do?

To quarantine your new plants, simply set them up in a separate area of your home, away from your other plants. Observe them closely for any signs of disease or pest problems, and take action if necessary. After a few weeks, you can then safely integrate them into your collection.

In conclusion, quarantining new house plants is a simple and effective way to protect your existing collection and help new plants adjust to their new environment. So next time you bring home a new plant, be sure to follow this important step in your plant care routine.
